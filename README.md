ML project 

We have made a application which will recognise the handwritten words and convert that
into computer written format.
Using the Convolution neural network and recurrent neuralnetworks obtained the 32*80 size output (sequence of 32 characters over 80 classes)
input image size was 32*128.

Loss function used for output is CTC(Connectionist temporal classification) loss function.
